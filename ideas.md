#### Ideas

* Animate the SWR sweep graph

  - https://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/animate_decay.html

  - https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/155905/time-scrolling-interface-in-matplotlib

* Android support (via USB OTG)

* Wireless support (Bluetooth using HC-05 likely) - might require hardware mods

* Eliminate `display` of weird `open line` SWR values

  - The AA shows values like 8.7, 17.4 in `open line` condition

  Note: When `SWR sweep` is running in `open line` condition, we don't get these weird values!
